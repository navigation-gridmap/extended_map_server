# Extended Map Server


This is part of my final degree work at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain, in the research group Intelligent Robotics Lab, headed by Francisco MartÃ­n Rico (@fmrico).


- Incorporated `grid_map` and `octomap` to the `map_server` and `map_saver`, in order to use Nav2 with non-planar maps. Therefore, `grid_map` and `octomap` dependencies where added to the package.

- Previous functionality conserved, allowing retrocompatibility

- Added tests

## How to use:

I added an `example.yaml`, `example.pgm`, `example_ele.pgm`, and `example_octo.ot` to `nav2_map_server/test` so it can be tried out easily.

### Serving the maps

At `navigation2/nav2_map_server/test`, the file `example.yaml` is:

    image: example.pgm
    mode: trinary
    resolution: 0.2
    origin: [0, 0, 0]
    negate: 0
    occupied_thresh: 0.65
    free_thresh: 0.25
    #  elevation layer
    elevation_image: example_ele.pgm
    min_height: -1.16
    max_height: 1.88
    #  octomap
    octomap_file: example_octo.ot
    binary: false     

`min_height` and `max_height` are necessary to convert the scale from the image pixels to a real metric value.

Note: octomap section is not necessary to load a grid_map with elevation information and grid_map section is not necessary to load and serve the octomap file.



With this file and `topic_name` parameter set to "map" (default):

    $ ros2 run nav2_map_server map_server --ros-args -p yaml_filename:=example.yaml
    .....
    .....

    $ ros2 lifecycle set /map_server 1
    Transition succesful
    $ ros2 lifecycle set /map_server 3
    Transition succesful

It creates 3 topics:
- `/$(topic_name)` : OccupancyGrid
- `/grid_map_$(topic_name)` : GridMap with `elevation` and `occupancy` (the same map as in /$(topic_name)) layers.
- `/octomap_$(topic_name)` : Octomap

### Saving the maps

When saving the maps, behaviour changes depending on the type of the topic and whether or not an octomap topic is specified.

- If the target map topic is a `nav_msgs/msg/OccupancyGrid` only a image of the 2d map is saved (the same as before).
- If the target map topic is a `grid_map_msgs/msg/GridMap` it will save the 2d map from the `occupancy` layer and the heigth information from the `elevation` layer.
- Additionally, if an octomap topic is specified, the octomap file is saved and its name written to the yaml file.

With the topics created from the previous example:

To create these topics to save the files from a Gazebo world simulation, the [fmrico/gazebo_gridmap_plugin](https://github.com/fmrico/gazebo_gridmap_plugin) can be used.
